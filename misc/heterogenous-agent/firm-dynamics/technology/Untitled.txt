What I Enjoyed: 
1. Macro for insights into "ECONOMICS"
(Ufuk Paper- Growth/Patents), HANK Monetary stuff.
2. Causal Effects Estimation in Econometrics (term paper), DML, Graphs; Chernosukohov Paper. Very very applicable - in Econ and Outside. 
3. RL stuff - Not as applicable outside. But super interesting.

What pays?
