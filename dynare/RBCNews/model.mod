/*
 * This file implements a simple RBC model with additively separable utility and TFP news calibrated to US data. It shows how 
 * to generate IRFs to a "pure" news shock where an 8 period anticipated news shock does not materialize at time 0. 
 * This is the type of policy experiment that is for example performed in Beaudry Portier (2004): An exploration  
 * into Pigouís theory of cycles, Journal of Monetary Economics 51, pp. 1183ñ1216.
 *
 * This is done using Dynare's simult_ function, which can be used to simulate time series given the decision rules. This capability
 * can be useful if user's want to use a particular shock series (e.g. truncated normal, historical smoothed shocks etc.)
 * 
 * Note that having two exactly offsetting shocks from continuous distributions to keep the exogenous variable constant 
 * is a 0 probability event for the agents of the model. 
 * 
 * Moreover, this mod-file shows how to use Dynare's capacities to generate TeX-files of the model equations. If you want to see the model
 * equations belonging to this mod-file, run it using Dynare and then use a TeX-editor to compile the TeX-files generated.
 *
 * This implementation was written by Johannes Pfeifer. In case you spot mistakes,
 * email me at jpfeifer@gmx.de
 *
 * This mod-file uses variable substitution to perform a log-linearization of the model. All variables,
 * except for the interest rate (which is already in percent), are put in exp() for this purpose.
 *
 * Please note that the following copyright notice only applies to this Dynare 
 * implementation of the model.
